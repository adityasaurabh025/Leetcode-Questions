        Dry Run with Specific Values:
Initialization:

arr = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
ans = []
First Iteration (i = 0):

Current interval: arr[0] = [1, 3]
Since ans is empty, the condition arr[i][0] > ans[-1][1] is not evaluated.
Add [1, 3] to ans:
lua
Copy code
ans = [[1, 3]]
Second Iteration (i = 1):

Current interval: arr[1] = [2, 6]
Compare arr[i][0] and ans[-1][1]:
arr[i][0] is 2
ans[-1][1] is 3 (end of last interval in ans)
Condition: 2 > 3 (False, they overlap)
Since they overlap, merge the intervals by updating the end value:
Update ans[-1][1] to max(3, 6) = 6:
lua
Copy code
ans = [[1, 6]]
Third Iteration (i = 2):

Current interval: arr[2] = [8, 10]
Compare arr[i][0] and ans[-1][1]:
arr[i][0] is 8
ans[-1][1] is 6 (end of last interval in ans)
Condition: 8 > 6 (True, no overlap)
Since there's no overlap, add [8, 10] to ans:
lua
Copy code
ans = [[1, 6], [8, 10]]
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):

Current interval: arr[3] = [15, 18]
Compare arr[i][0] and ans[-1][1]:
arr[i][0] is 15
ans[-1][1] is 10 (end of last interval in ans)
Condition: 15 > 10 (True, no overlap)
Since there's no overlap, add [15, 18] to ans:
lua

ans = [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
Summary of Key Values:
First Iteration: No overlap check since ans is empty.
Second Iteration:
Compare arr[1][0] = 2 with ans[-1][1] = 3
Condition: 2 > 3 (False, they overlap)
Third Iteration:
Compare arr[2][0] = 8 with ans[-1][1] = 6
Condition: 8 > 6 (True, no overlap)
Fourth Iteration:
Compare arr[3][0] = 15 with ans[-1][1] = 10
Condition: 15 > 10 (True, no overlap)

The condition arr[i][0] > ans[-1][1] checks if the start of the current interval (arr[i][0]) is greater than the end of the last interval in ans (ans[-1][1]). If true, it means there's no overlap, and the current interval can be added to ans. If false, it means there's an overlap, and the intervals need to be merged.
